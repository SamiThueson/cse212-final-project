# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every Python programmer should understand these topics:

* [Queue](1-queue.md)

* [Linked List](2-linkedlist.md)

* [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
